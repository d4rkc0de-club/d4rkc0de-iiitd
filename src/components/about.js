                        Itâ€™s a general notion that Compute Science and Technology is just about coding. We often forget
                        the most critical aspect of it, which is security. A vulnerable software jeopardises the privacy
                        of the user. Having knowledge about it is very important. So we present to you d4rkc0de, the
                        cyber security club of IIIT Delhi.

                        <br />
                        Cyber security is a relatively unknown field to most because of a lack of awareness and
                        resources. We at d4rkc0de aim to change that.

                        <br />
                        We share various resources and conduct live, hands-on sessions for the same. We provide a
                        platform for people to discuss cyber security. To keep the competitive spirit, we also have
                        various tournaments with amazing prizes.

                        <br />
                        We only ask for your willingness to learn.
